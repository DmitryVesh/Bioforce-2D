Need to run Bioforce 2D v0.5.6.exe, and choose either LocalHost or Manual ip setting connection in menu, in order to connect to your computer. 
	As I have not implemented looking through each LAN ip and checking if its a server. Currently set to hard coded value of my computer on network.
Can run as many same .exe instances of the game, so can have many clients from same device.
Need to run GameServer.exe in order to establish connection to server.

The game has some music, so might be very loud when you join in.
No support for gamepad yet, its coming in this finished version.
I document an UpdateLog.txt file which contains all things i have done with the game since version 0
