Implementing scripts
--------------------
1 PlayerMovement, which allows the player to run and sprint, using branched, branchless, hybrid branched/brancless methods (hybrid is executed fastest)
1 PlayerAnimations, giving the player animations, via use of animation data that is received from PlayerMovement, through GetAnimationData(), flip sprite when moving in opposite direction
1 SimpleCameraFollow, makes the camera follow the player, when the camera child of the player is detached from player, so can see player facing left and right
