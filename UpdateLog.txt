1 Added NonLocalPlayerAnimations and EntityWalking to OtherPlayer prefab. So non local players are animated.

Implementing scripts
--------------------
1 Added NonLocalPlayerAnimations, which is similar to PlayerAnimationsNetworking, enables to be put onto non local players, and get updates
	of the player movement stats, changing SpeedX of the player, using the Event defined in PlayerManager script.
1 Renamed PlayerAnimationsNetworking script to LocalPlayerAnimations, and made it to so it inherets from NonLocalPlayerAnimations.
	Overrides awake, fixedUpdate and YaxisAnimations, so able to correct the SpeedX and triggering the jumped animation trigger.
1 Add EntityWalking, script placed on non local players, and for future enemies, which is a brief PlayerMovementNetworking script, with a ground check.
	PlayerMovementNetworking inherits from it.
1 Edit PlayerMovementNetworking, made it inherit from EntityWalking, took away methods and properties that are found in the inherited class.
1 Edit Client, changed PacketHandler dictionary initiliasation to combine the playerVelocity and playerRotation, and added player movement stats.
1 Edit ClientRead, added reading of runSpeed and sprintSpeed to the spawn packet. Added a new handler for playerMovementStats packet, which sets the player movement stats of a player.
1 Edit ClientSend, changed the Vector3 to a vector2, so habe to transmit less data.
1 Edit PlayerManager, added a delegate and event which notifies the subscribed nonLocalPlayerAnimations of a change in the playermovement stats, removed rigidBody because it was not used, 
	and added velocity and player movement stats fields. 
1 Edit Packet, added server packets for playerRotationAndVelocity and movement stats. Added a vector2 write and read method.

GameServer code
---------------
1 Edit Packet, added server packets for playerRotationAndVelocity and movement stats. Added a vector2 write and read method.
1 Edit Player, changed velocity to vector2, made runSpeed and sprintSpeed public, calls to send the PlayerRotationAndVelocity, not just rotation.
1 Edit ServerRead, changed velocity to vector2, and added a serverSend call of the playerMovementStats when receiving a movement stats packet, which sends it to all players.
1 Edit ServerSend, changed seperate PlayerRotation and velocity packets into 1, and added a movement stats packet, sending to all via TCP to make sure it doesn't get lost.w

===============================================================================================================================
Version 0.4

Summary
-------
Main goals is to;
	1 Let the player choose how to try connect to the server, via LocalHost, LAN or Internet. Allowing for over internet connections,
		an IP connectiong setting dropdown list
	1 Add player user names to the players, so players can know who is in the server.
	1 Add timeouts, so if player trying to connect to server for too long, gets timed out. Allowing for player to try and reconnect, if chosen
		wrong IP connection setting, or the server is just slow.
	1 Make a Level 1 map, and load into game so can see how action on a map occurs.

			
Future tasks;
	Fix non local player animations

Importing assets
----------------
1 Level 1 - Warped_city art assets.

UnityEditor
-----------
1 Add a OnValueChanged event to the InputField, which calls OnUsernameInputField method in SimpleNetworkingUI, checks if the username entered is valid, if valid makes 
	Connect button interactable, if not then not interactable.
1 Add a IPAddress TMP dropdown list, which is responsible for player choosing what IPAddress to connect to. Has OnValueChanged event, which calls SimpleNetworkingUI
	OnIPAddressDropDownChanged.
1 Added Description Text, child of IPAddressDropdown, mentions that 
1 Make a PlayerModel prefab, which just holds the player model, rigidbody and capsule collider.
1 Edit LocalPlayer, so it holds a child gameObject of PlayerModel, delete the player model from the parent Local player object. Set cinemachine follow to the PlayerModel.
1 Make OtherPlayer gameObject, which is the non-local player, child the PlayerModel to it, and add PlayerManagerScript to it.
1 Added a UI canvas (UsernameCanvas) and TextMeshProText (Username Text TMP) as children to PlayerModel, so the player username can be displayed.
1 Added a IgnoreParentRotation script to the UsernameCanvas, so flipping the sprite of the gameObject doesn't change the 
1 Added a TimeOutPanel, TimeOut Text, Continue Button, to act as a time out message when a connection fails via a timeout. The Continue Button has an onClick event which calls the 
	SimpleNetworkingUI OnTimeOutContinueBtnPresss.
1 Edit Shooter sprite pixels per unit, decreasing the player size.
1 Edit CinemachineCamera lens to 6, so can see more of the map.
1 Added folder for Prefabs from Warped_city art, including banners, and individual parts.
1 Add 5 different house types into the game.
1 Add a new Scene named Level 1, use the houses made to make a basic level.
1 Add background to game.
1 Added 3 different prespective cameras that view individual background elements, allowing for a parallex effect.
1 Increased gravity to -15.81, felt better when the player is jumping, speeding up the time it takes for the player to hit the ground, feels more responsive.
1 Increased animation Samples to the Run animation to 7, and to Sprint animation to 8, making the player feel more responsive and faster.

Implementing scripts
--------------------
1 Edit Client, Add different IP addresses; localHost, LAN and Internet, so can connect computers wherever they are. (Portwarded on my router)
	Added method ChangeIPAddressConnectTo, which changes the IPAddress which the player will connect to, called by SimpleNetworkingUI.
	Added timer and methods which work on the connection time out, timer is started when the ConnectToServer is called, and stopped when either the timer reaches a TimerTimeOutTime
	value, or when a SuccessfullyConnected method is called. When the time out occurs, the ConnectionTimedOut is called, which disconnects the client from the server, and displays
	the TimeOutPanel. When a successful connection occurs, ClientRead welcome read calls the successful connection method, the timer is reset and turned off.
1 Edit SimpleNetworkingUI, Added OnUsernameInputFieldChanged, called by OnValueChanged event on InputField, then calls inputfield validation method, 
	and makes the ConnectBtn interactable when valid.
	Also added a OnIPAddressDropdownChanged method, which is called by OnValueChanged event on IPAddressInputField, calls Client's ChangeIPAddressConnectTo, giving the index
	of the IPAddress.
	Added a DisplayTimeOutMessage, which activates the TimeOutPanel and calls the SetInteractableConnectionMenu with false, so player has to read message and press ContinueButton.
	Added a OnTimeOutContinueBtnPress, which is called by Continue button, deactivates the TimeOutPanel and makes the connection menu interactable.
1 Edit PlayerManager, cache the player model gameObject, and reference its rigidBody in the initialise and transfrom in SetPosition.
	Added a SetRotation method which changes the PlayerModel rotation.
1 Edit PlayerMovementNetworking, cache the player model gameObject, and set its rigidBody, CapsuleCollider in Awake, also change SendMovesToServer to send the PlayerModel's data.
	Added IgnoreLayerCollisions in MovementY, which ignores collision between the gameObject's layer attached to it, and the Platform layer when going up and when holding press
	down button.
1 Edit PlayerAnimationsNetworking, cache the player model gameObject, get its animator, and change its transform in FlipSprite;
1 Bug: When sending the position of player to server, sometimes the opposite value for x coord gets sent... 
	Only happens when turning the player...
	Checked for packets sent from player to server, the error in position doesn't occur from sending local player packets, happens on the server or receiving end.
	Deoesn't occur when setting position from received packet... 
	The point at which the x coordinate is changed is the initial spawn location of the object that it happens on...
	It is to do with the OtherPlayer gameObject rotation being changed, so the PlayerModel position coordinate x changes from negative to positive or positive to negative, 
	so sometimes doesn't have time to switch the rotation, causing the problem, transform change sent from server should apply to PlayerModel, not to OtherPlayer!
1 IgnoreParentRotation, resets the gameObject's transform to 0,0,0 every late, overriding changes made in transform update of parent object. 
1 Edit ClientRead, in PlayerRotation, instead of changing the player's actual rotation, a SetRotation method is called.
	Edited the WelcomeRead method to call the Client instance SuccessfullyConnected method, instead of just setting the id of client manually.


GameServer code
---------------
1 Edit ServerRead, put a try catch block for the PlayerMovementRead, because ran into issues, where a packet is received from an already deleted player, causing crashing.

===============================================================================================================================
Version 0.3
-----------

Summary
-------
Main goal is to fix camera jiteriness, stop the non local players from teleporting quickly when falling and jumping,
	 handle client and server disconnects
	1 import and use cinemachine camera, so gets rid of jetiry motion of the camera
	1 stop non local player teleporting when in air
	1 handle client disconnections (still issues when 2 or more clients disconnect simultaneously)
			
Future tasks;
	improve collision detection,
	player attacking (shooting),
	player dying and respawning
	make a movement cooldown if a player fully exhausted the stamina bar, decrease run speed, don't allow to try and sprint

Importing assets
----------------
1 Cinemachine, will use the cinemachine camera for local player, so camera will be smooth and in future can easily add camera effects for shooting, taking damage, etc...

UnityEditor
-----------
1 Removed and deleted from project the SimpleCameraFollow script from camera that looks at the player.
1 Added CinemachineBrain to Main Camera, which will be used as parent for other cameras that look at the foregroumd, background and etc...
1 Added a CinemachineCamera and CinemachineVirtualCamera to the it that will follow the player.
1 Adjusted CinemachineVirtualCamera to follow and look at the LocalPlayer, and tweaked Aim component to have a Composer camera with adjusted zones.
1 Added LocalPlayer layer which is set to LocalPlayer, so can use normal Player as whatIsGround to fix infinite jumping due to detecting itself as ground.
1 Added to LocalPlayer whatIsGround the player layer, so can bounce on other players.
1 Set non local Player Rigidbody2D into Static mode, preventing local machine calculating the gravity and creating a teleporting effecting when in air.


Implementing scripts
--------------------
1 DetachFromParent, sets gameObject transform parent to null, applied to CinemachineCamera
1 Edit Client, added proper disconnections to the TCP, UDP and Client instance itself to disconnect from the server properly, inside the try catch blocks in BeginReadReceiveCallBacks.
	Moved instantiation of tcp and udp to the ConnectToServer method instead of Start, allowing for player to be re-connect after server is shutdown.
1 Edit Packet, added playerDisconnect to ServerPackets enum, so server able to sends to connected clients that a player has disconnected.
1 PlayerCameraController, holds the CinemachineCamera gameObject, needs to be assigned by Inspector, adds an OnDestroyObject method which destroys the camera, when the LocalPlayer is destroyed.
	Preventing multiple CinemachineCameras being around, when the server is shutdown and player is sent back to Connect Screen.
1 Edit SimpleNetworkingUI, added Disconnected method which re-enables the Networking UI, after Local client is disconnected.
1 Edit PlayerManager, added Disconnect method which destroys the LocalPlayer gameObject. Called by GameManager, upon getting the disconnect client packet, and when localPlayer is disconnected.
1 Edit ClientRead, added a PlayerDisconnect packet handler, which calls Disconnect method of PlayerManager.
1 Edit GameManager, added Disconneting particular and DisconnetingAllPlayers method.

GameServer code
---------------
1 Edit Client, added similar disconnections to the TCP, UDP and Client.
1 Edit Packet, ""
1 Edit Player, Changed in ValidMove, the xMaxLeftTravelledLeft - 0.5f, instead of + 0.5f, due to going left/negative x direction.
1 Edit ServerSend, added DisconnectPlayer packet which is sent to all players via TCP.
1 Edit Server, added an event for when the console application is closed, which stops the tcpListener and udpClient, preventing server from listening to the port when shutting down.

1 TMP (TextMeshPro) Essentials - used for higher resolution texts that appear on the screen.

UnityEditor
-----------
1 Updated UnityEditor to version 2020.1.12f1
1 Creating a ClientManager gameObject and attaching to Player - Holds the Client, ClientRead & ThreadManager Scripts
1 Making a Canvas that holds the NetworkMenu gameObject which has the SimpleNetworkingUI script, that controls when to connect the client to server.
	Through use of a ConnectBtn, which has an onClickEvent that triggers the ConnectToServer method in SimpleNetworkingUI.
1 Made a LocalPlayer and Player prefabs, similar to original Player gameObect. 
	LocalPlayer contains PlayerMovementNetworking and PlayerAnimationsNetworking scripts
	Player doesn't contain the scripts for playerMovement, and animation, to prevent the local client controlling not their own players.
	Both contain PlayerManager script, so can update local and other players.

Materials
---------
1 LocalPlayer material which makes the local player sprite Red
1 Player material which makes the other player sprites Blue


Implementing scripts
--------------------
1 Client, singleton, holds the client id, tcp, databuffersize (used as a the number of bytes that is sent with each transmission), IP address and port number.
	The tcp is a class which contains a TcpClient (socket), the id, byte array which is the stream receive buffer, and a NetworkStream.
	A Connect method assigns a new socket, then assigns the same send & receive buffer sizes to the data buffer size of the Client.
	The socket begins to connect to the IP, port through its own state. Giving ConnectCallback method as the AsyncCallback, which checks for connection and begins to read data stream
	The NetworkStream is assigned to the socket stream. Data is then continuosly read, until an error occurs or the no bytes are sent in the stream.
	Initialises the Packet dictionary.
1 SimpleNetworkingUI, singleton, which holds the NetworkMenu (UI element which is turned off when a ConnectBtn is clicked on, contains the ConnectBtn and the UserName InputField)
	Gets the NetworkMenu and username inputField from the children gameObjects. 
	Has a ConnectToServer method which is triggered by the ConnectBtn, which deactivates the NetworkMenu and Calls the Client singleton to connect to server.
1 ClientRead, used to read contents of packets sent to the client, and handles the data. Currently able to read a welcome packet, setting ClientID of Client to the id received in packet 
	and print the welcome message from server. Calls ClientSend.WelcomePacketReply to send back the ClientID and Username. Receives UDPTest packet and calls the reply to server.
	Reads spawnPlayer, playerPosition, playerVelocity and playerRotation packets.
1 ClientSend, used to send packets from client to the server. Currently able to send confirmation that a welcome packet received, sending back ClientID and Username entered.
	Able to send packet as TCP or UDP, as well as replying to Welcome and UDP test packets.
	Sends out PlayerMovement and PlayerMovementStats packets.
1 Packet, same Packet class as used in GameServer code
1 ThreadManager, a single thread manager, used to execute networking commands in a queue, need to remake it make it multi-threaded. To get things up and running I used a pre-made ThreadManager class
1 GameManager, singleton which holds all the playerManagers, LocalPlayerPrefab and PlayerPrefab. Responsible for spawning players.
1 PlayerManager, holds the ID, username and rigidBody of player, able to set the position of player and add velocity to the rigidBody of the player.
1 PlayerMovementNetworking, same as PlayerMovement, however now also sends the position of player to Server, and sends the playerMovementStats to the server, runSpeed and sprintSpeed, so checks for valid moves.

GameServer code
---------------
1 Program, holds the start point of the game server, initialises a console application, and calls the Server.StartServer with player number limit and port to use.
	Sets a new thread, which is used to call MainThread, which updates the GameLogic every tick.
	Currently a 30 tick server, so unity game project was set to 30 ticks to, to prevent data being sent that should be ignored.
1 Server, holds the player limit, port number that is used for the connection, clients (dictionary) and a tcpListener (used to listen to tcp requests). 
	The server initiliases all clients on starting, populating the client dictionary, and intiliasing all the packets to read.
	Assigns new tcpListener that can communicate on any IP addresses, on port number stored.
	The tcpListener starts to listen to requests, and begins accepting clients indefinetely.
	
1 Client, holds the client id, tcp and databuffersize (used as a the number of bytes that is sent with each transmission).
	The tcp is a class which contains a TcpClient (socket), the id, byte array which is the stream receive buffer, and a NetworkStream.
	A Connect method takes a TcpClient (socket) and assigns to its own socket, then assigns the same send & receive buffer sizes to the data buffer size of the Client.
	The NetworkStream is assigned to the socket stream. Data is then continuosly read, until an error occurs or the no bytes are sent in the stream.
	SendIntoGame, sends the player into the game, by creating new Player, spawning that player into all other connected clients, also spawns all connected clients to the new player.
1 Packet, using an already made Packet class, could write my own Packet class but that would take too long, due to need to learn translation from datatypes to bytes and back... 
	Translates data like int, float, string into bytes, and translates the bytes back into the datatypes. Using the buffer, readposition (used for assigning how many bytes are read and written
	due to different datatypes taking up different number of bytes).
	Has enum ServerPackets which holds all packets the server sends, and enum ClientPacket holding the packets that the client sends to server.
1 ThreadManager, same class as in Unity Project, used to queue actions like updating GameLogic.
1 ServerSend, sends packets from the server to the Clients, using Packet syntax. Can send to specific recipient, all or exclude specific clients. Able to send via TCP or UDP. Sends the Welcome, UDPTest, SpawnPlayer
	Player position, velocity and rotation packets.
1 ServerRead, reads packets sent from Clients to the Server. Gets back Welcome packet with clientID and username, then stores username inside ClientDictionary - Player. 
	Receives the UDPTest Packet, and the PlayerMovement and PlayerMovementStats.
1 GameLogic, will act as processor of game data, calls ThreadManager.UpdateMain when Update is called. Called by Program MainThread, where a single thread is made and used to update the game state.
	Calls the connected players' Update methods.
1 Player, holds all data on the player server side, ID, username, position, velocity, rotation...
	Has an Update method, which currently calls MovePlayer, which calls ServerSend to send the player's position and rotation to all other players, apart from self.
	Checks if the position that the player now is valid (only checks the X axis so far, but need to check Y axis), if not valid then sends the valid possible to all players including itself self.
